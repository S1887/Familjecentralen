# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Git Push Rules

**NEVER push code without explicit user approval!**

## Workflow:

1. Make code changes locally
2. Test changes locally (user verifies on localhost)
3. **WAIT for user confirmation that it works**
4. **ASK user if they want to push**
5. Only then: bump version, commit, and push

## Key Points:

- Always test in local environment first
- Never auto-push after making changes
- User must explicitly say "push" or "pusha" before pushing
- If user says "pusha ej" or "don't push", do NOT push
